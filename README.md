# final-project-backend
This repository only served so that I would be able to connect the backend of the Smart Brain app on a separate server independent from the front end.\
The actual code that is in this repository is the same as in the [main](https://github.com/markobachvarovski/final-project/tree/main/final-project-backend) repository
